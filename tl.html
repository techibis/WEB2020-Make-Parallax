			<p>Being part of TechLaunch.io is a very unique experience.  Not only are the people in the program very warm and welcoming, but it is fun to learn and be part of this classroom each and every day.  In the TechLaunch.io, there are various classrooms, but I love my classroom the best because it has some very special components.</p>

			<p>I love the way that each student can sit comfortably at their station.  The seats lean back and are adjustable, and each station has a good view of the projector and the board up in the front of the room.  I love the power connectors.  They have multiple power sockets for each student so they can change multiple devices simultaneously.</p>

			<p>The walls in the classroom are also special.  They have some art that is not only inspirational but it moves those who enter the room to feel like anything is possible here.  We can be hungry for success, remember our own motivations, and then hustle to make the best future for ourselves.</p>

			<p>And just for some added fun, the classroom is equipped with an oculus rift developer kit.  I can only imagine how much fun it would be so see your own creation to come alive in 3D in a virtual world.  With the headset on, I can be anything.</p>
